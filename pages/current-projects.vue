                                            <th>Rescue app started as a response to COVID-19, due to the decentralisation of information about supply and demand of sanitary resources in Spain.<br> 

                                            We created a platform to centralise and match supply and demand of sanitary resources.<br> 

                                            On one side, hospitals, elderly residences or individuals request what they need.<br> 

                                            In the other side, companies or people producing those materials register what they can donate.<br> 

                                            Then we prioritise and match those resources with who most needs them.<br> 

                                            From idea to launch, took us 3 days and in just a month we received 46,000+ offers, 74,000+ requests and we were able to match 36,000+ sanitary resources.<br> 

                                            With Rescue app, we learned that if you put a group of people with different skills together, organise them in a specific way, and apply technology to the agreed solution, they can exponentially increase their impact on any social cause.<br> 

                                            We need support in Sales and Account Management.<br>

                                            Calm Tag is a clothing label, simple and easily integrated into clothing, designed for elderly dependents and small children, which facilitates their location in case of loss, simply by reading it with a mobile phone.<br>
